# Eagle Eye Analytics

  Eagle Eye Analytics is an area analysis software designed to help users determine crowd size over time at designated areas. Our team built a custom API for Netgear Arlo cameras which allows recorded videos and their thumbnails to be analyzed by AWS Rekognition. Using data returned by Rekogntion, Eagle Eye's Proprietary algorithms return a detailed analysis of how many people are in each area at each time, in real time.
     
  Eagle Eye's Proprietary algorithms return an analysis of the distribution of aggregate number of people in the areaa distribution of as the number of unique people who visit each area, also tabulated in real time. 
  
  Eagle Eye Analytics can also take a live photo of a person and produce an album of thumbnails that were captured containing that particular person, essentially tracking every unique person's movements every moment they are in range of the program.
